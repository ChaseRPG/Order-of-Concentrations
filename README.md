# Order-of-Concentrations
I'm using GitHub to allow people to review and comment of code I make, beginning with simple python scripts like this. All comments and critiques welcome! 

As chemical reactions take place, the concentration of a substance will decrease. This decrease is partly determined by the order of it, which is what I want to automate 
here. Using python, I'm trying to take the inputs of two different experiments and automate the process of identifying a constant, identifying by what multiple the 
variable was added, and comparing it to the change of the initial rate.

explaining things

for example, [NO] (subscript 0 just means at the initial rate) would be the constant (1) in reactions 1 and 2 while [CL2] would be the "variable'. if the variable is 
doubled, you would look at the rates for the reactions and compare them. since the substance was multiplied by 2(2), we would take the 2 and multiply it with the first 
rate .18. You find orders by filling in the power of the number multiplied, the number being two. since .18 * 2 = .36, the power of 2 would be 1(3), making the order of 
CL2 1(4). It is and sounds complicated dont get me wrong, thats why I thought it would be fun to automate it.
